# TEXT TO SPEECH
It imports the pyttsx3 library, which is a Python library for text-to-speech conversion.
It initializes the text-to-speech engine using pyttsx3.init().
It defines a function text_to_speech that takes input text as well as optional parameters for speech rate (rate) and voice type (voice_id).
Inside the function, it sets the speech rate and voice type if specified by the user.
It prints the text that is going to be converted to speech.
It converts the input text to speech using engine.say(text) and engine.runAndWait() functions.
It includes an exception handling block to catch any errors that may occur during the text-to-speech conversion process and prints them out.
